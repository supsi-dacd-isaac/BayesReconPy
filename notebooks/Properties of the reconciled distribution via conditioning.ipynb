    "This vignette reproduces the results of the paper *Properties of the reconciled distributions for Gaussian and count forecasts* (Zambon et al. 2024), accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. We replicate here the results obtained in the original [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesRecon/vignettes/reconciliation_properties.html).\n",

    "The R package released a new data set, containing time series of counts of extreme market events in five economic sectors in the period 2005-2018 (3508 trading days). The counts are computed by considering 29 companies included in the Euro Stoxx 50 index and observing if the value of the CDS spread on a given day exceeds the 90-th percentile of its distribution in the last trading year. The companies are divided into the following sectors: Financial (FIN), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Manufacturing (MFG), Energy (ENG), and Trade (TRD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy is composed of 5 bottom time series, the daily number of extreme market\n",
    "\n",
    "events in each sector, and 1 upper time series (the sum of the different sectors). Data are stored in `extr_mkt_events.pkl`.\n",
