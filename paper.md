# Summary

`BayesReconpy` implement methods for probabilistic forecast reconciliation in Python. It reconciles hierarchies containing real-valued time series,  discrete time series and a mixture of real-valued and discrete time series (mixed hierarchies). The package is released under 

## Introduction

Time series are often structured hierarchicallyâ€”for example, item-level sales can be aggregated by product, category, or store [Makridakis et al., 2022]. These aggregations define linear constraints that the data naturally satisfy (*coherent* data).

However, forecasts generated independently for each series (*base forecasts*) typically violate these constraints, leading to *incoherent* predictions. Reconciliation methods adjust base forecasts to restore coherence.

Early work focused on reconciling point forecasts [Hyndman et al., 2011; Wickramasuriya et al., 2019], while more recent research has proposed probabilistic methods that produce coherent predictive distributions [Jeon et al., 2019; Taieb et al., 2021; Panagiotelis et al., 2023; Girolimetto et al., 2024].

**bayesReconPy**, the Python adaptation of the R package **bayesRecon**, implements probabilistic reconciliation via conditioning. It supports hierarchies with:

- Gaussian base forecasts [Corani et al., 2021]  
- Continuous non-Gaussian [Zambon et al., 2024]  
- Discrete [Corani et al., 2024; Zambon et al., 2024]  
- Mixed continuous and discrete distributions [Zambon, 2024]

The package also includes projection-based reconciliation methods and their probabilistic extensions:

- OLS [Hyndman et al., 2011]  
- MinT [Wickramasuriya et al., 2019]
