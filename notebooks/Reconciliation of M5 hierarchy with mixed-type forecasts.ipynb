    "This page reproduces the results as presented in *Probabilistic reconciliation of mixed-type hierarchical time series* (Zambon et al. 2024), published at UAI 2024 (the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we replicate the reconciliation of the one-step ahead (h=1) forecasts of one store of the M5 competition (Makridakis, Spiliotis, and Assimakopoulos 2022). Sect. 5 of the paper presents the results for 10 stores, each reconciled 14 times using rolling one-step ahead forecasts.\n",
    "The original vignette containing the R counterpart of this page can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesRecon/vignettes/mixed_reconciliation.html).## \n",

    "The M5 competition (Makridakis, Spiliotis, and Assimakopoulos 2022) is about daily time series of sales data referring to 10 different stores. Each store has the same hierarchy: 3049 bottom time series (single items) and 11 upper time series, obtained by aggregating the items by department, product category, and store; see the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![M5.png](pictures/M5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We reproduce the results of the store “CA_1”. The base forecasts (for h=1) of the bottom and upper time series are stored in `M5_CA1_basefc` available as data in the original **‘[bayesRecon](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesRecon/index.html)’** package in R. The base forecast are computed using ADAM (Svetunkov and Boylan 2023), implemented in the R package smooth (Svetunkov 2023)."
