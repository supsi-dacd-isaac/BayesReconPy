    "This page reproduces the results as presented in *Probabilistic reconciliation of mixed-type hierarchical time series* (Zambon et al. 2024), published at UAI 2024 (the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we replicate the reconciliation of the one-step ahead (h=1) forecasts of one store of the M5 competition (Makridakis, Spiliotis, and Assimakopoulos 2022). Sect. 5 of the paper presents the results for 10 stores, each reconciled 14 times using rolling one-step ahead forecasts.\n",

    "\n",
    "The M5 competition (Makridakis, Spiliotis, and Assimakopoulos 2022) is about daily time series of sales data referring to 10 different stores. Each store has the same hierarchy: 3049 bottom time series (single items) and 11 upper time series, obtained by aggregating the items by department, product category, and store; see the figure below.\n",

    "\n",
    "We reproduce the results of the store “CA_1”. The base forecasts (for h=1) of the bottom and upper time series are stored in `M5_CA1_basefc` available as data in the original **‘[bayesRecon](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesRecon/index.html)’** package in R. The base forecasts are computed using ADAM (Svetunkov and Boylan 2023), implemented in the R package smooth (Svetunkov 2023).\n"
